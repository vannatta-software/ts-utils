# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Reviewing and updating the memory bank for the TS-Utils project based on user feedback.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized all core memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

## Next Steps
- Review `systemPatterns.md`.
- Review `techContext.md`.
- Review `progress.md`.
- Confirm all memory bank files are up-to-date.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring all core memory bank files are present and contain initial, relevant information.
- The content of these initial files is based on the current understanding of the TS-Utils project structure and purpose.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adhering to the specified memory bank structure and file naming conventions.
- Providing clear and concise information in each memory bank file.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The TS-Utils project is a monorepo containing `core`, `domain`, and `frontend` packages.
- Each package has its own `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js`, indicating independent build and test configurations.
- The `src` directories within each package contain various utility files, suggesting a modular design.
