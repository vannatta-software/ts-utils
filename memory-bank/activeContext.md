# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Setting up a new `server` package for server infrastructure elements within the TS-Utils monorepo.

## Recent Changes
- Created the `packages/server` directory and its initial files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.js`, `src/index.ts`).
- Updated `lerna.json` to include the new `packages/server` in the monorepo.
- Updated `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` to reflect the addition of the `server` package.

## Next Steps
- Review existing NestJS-flavored server elements and abstract them for broader use across different server frameworks (NestJS, Express).
- Continue with other pending tasks as outlined in `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The decision to use TypeScript path aliases was crucial for resolving internal package references in the monorepo setup. This approach maintains the published package naming convention while allowing for seamless development within the monorepo.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adhering to the specified memory bank structure and file naming conventions.
- Providing clear and concise information in each memory bank file.
- Prioritizing TypeScript's built-in features (like path aliases) for monorepo management over complex build configurations.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Monorepo setups with internal package dependencies require careful `tsconfig.json` configuration, specifically using `paths` to map package names to their source directories.
- It's important to distinguish between published package names and internal relative paths, and to use `paths` to bridge this gap for development.
