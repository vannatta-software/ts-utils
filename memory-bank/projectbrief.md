# Project Brief

## Project Name
TS-Utils

## Project Goal
To provide a comprehensive suite of TypeScript utility packages for various domains, including core functionalities, domain-driven design patterns, and frontend development helpers.

## Core Requirements
- **Modularity**: Each utility set should be a separate, importable package.
- **Testability**: All utilities must be thoroughly tested.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation for each utility.
- **Performance**: Efficient implementations where applicable.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system for robust and error-free code.

## Target Audience
Developers working with TypeScript, especially those building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Initial Scope
- `packages/core`: Fundamental utilities (e.g., Array, String, Number, Http, File, Time, Validation, Reflection, Masking, EventSource, FetchBuffer, UpdateHandler, ApiClient, ResponseUtils).
- `packages/domain`: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns (e.g., AggregateRoot, Entity, ValueObject, Repository, UniqueIdentifier, GlobalIdentifier, Enumeration, Events, Model).
- `packages/frontend`: Frontend-specific utilities (e.g., BaseStore, ClientConnection, CookieUtils, EntityStore, HttpUtils, ServiceConnection, EndpointCollection, EndpointProvider, WebSocketProvider, WebSocketUtils).
- `packages/server`: Server infrastructure elements for various server frameworks (e.g., NestJS, Express) to tie together domain elements.

## Future Considerations
- Expansion of utility categories.
- Integration with popular frameworks.
- Community contributions.
