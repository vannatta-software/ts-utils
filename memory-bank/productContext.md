# Product Context

## Why TS-Utils Exists
TS-Utils aims to reduce boilerplate code and promote consistent patterns across TypeScript projects. It provides a centralized, well-tested collection of common functionalities that would otherwise be re-implemented in various projects, leading to inconsistencies and potential bugs.

## Problems Solved
- **Code Duplication**: Offers reusable components for common tasks.
- **Inconsistency**: Provides standardized implementations for utilities and design patterns.
- **Development Speed**: Accelerates development by providing ready-to-use, robust solutions.
- **Maintainability**: Centralizes utility logic, making updates and bug fixes easier.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures strong typing throughout the utility functions, reducing runtime errors.

## How it Should Work
- **Easy Integration**: Packages should be easily installable via npm/yarn.
- **Clear APIs**: Each utility should have a well-defined and intuitive API.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to a minimum to avoid bloat.
- **Tree-shakable**: Allow bundlers to remove unused code for smaller build sizes.

## User Experience Goals
- **Developer Productivity**: Enable developers to write less code and focus on business logic.
- **Reliability**: Provide highly reliable and thoroughly tested utilities.
- **Understandability**: Make the codebase easy to understand and contribute to.
- **Flexibility**: Offer utilities that can be adapted to various project structures and needs.
