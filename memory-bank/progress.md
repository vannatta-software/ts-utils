# Progress

## What Works
- The monorepo structure is in place with `core`, `domain`, and `frontend` packages.
- Basic TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) exists for each package.
- Jest testing framework is configured for each package.
- Initial utility files are present in their respective `src` directories.
- The memory bank directory and all core files have been successfully created and reviewed.

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive documentation for each utility and design pattern.
- Full test coverage for all existing utilities.
- CI/CD pipeline setup (if applicable).
- Publishing process for npm packages.
- Examples and usage guides for each package.
- Further development of specific utilities based on identified needs.

## Current Status
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Complete. All core files have been created and reviewed.
- **Project Structure**: Established.
- **Core Utilities**: Initial files present, content needs to be fleshed out and tested.
- **Domain Patterns**: Initial files present, content needs to be fleshed out and tested.
- **Frontend Helpers**: Initial files present, content needs to be fleshed out and tested.

## Known Issues
- No known issues at this initial stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to use a monorepo was made to centralize utility development and facilitate internal dependency management.
- The separation into `core`, `domain`, and `frontend` packages reflects a clear architectural intent to categorize utilities by their primary concern.
